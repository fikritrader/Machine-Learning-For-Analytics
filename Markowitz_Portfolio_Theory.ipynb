        "Rather than putting everything on a single place as one investment, he emphasized on creating a diverse portfolio from different industries and then optimizing the risk involved in it.\n",
        "These industries shouldn’t be having correlations between them or the correlations between them should be minimum in order to prevent additional risks from coming up.\n",
        "This optimized portfolio leads to higher returns also.\n",

        "The correlation between share X and share Y = 0.2 or 20%. We know that 0.2(20%) is very far away from 1(100%). The positive correlation denotes that as share X increases, share Y also increases and as share X decreases, share Y decreases but this relation is very small."

        "One thing to be noticed over here is since the share Y has more expected return and less standard deviation, as we increased weight towards share Y, we got increased expected return and decreased standard deviation. But, generally, in real-world, shares of high expected return involve high standard deviation and that of low expected return involve low standard deviation. So, in real-world, we would be experiencing both of them moving high together.\n",
